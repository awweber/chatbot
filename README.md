# Coding a Chatbot with python and Scikit-Learn

## The chatbot
1. The chatbot is able to recognize labels based on a sentence entered by the user and then searches for a random answer from the respective label.

| Sentences | Labels | Responses |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Hello | Greeting | Hello, how can I help you? |
| Bye bye | Farewell | Goodbye! |
| Danke | Thanks | You are welcome! |

2. The data model behind the chatbot is a 'bog of words'-model (BoW)
3. Machine learning (classification algorithm) is used to classify an unknown sentence into one of the available categories (labels) after training.
